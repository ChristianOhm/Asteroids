The loud beeping noise of your navigation computers proximity alert wakes you up from fitful sleep. Red lights are flashing through your cockpit. Your head is aching and it takes a while to remember how you got here.

Last night, you had been drinking with strangers in the "Monkey Bar" on Starbase 5 to celebrate your latest succesful drug trading tour. With your head full of Synthenol, all you wanted was getting back to earth quickly. It seems, yo messed up your nav course and now ended up in an asteroid field.

Your small vessel shakes as the first piece of rock impacts with your shields. You are surrounded by asteroids from all sites. To survive, you have to fight your way out, no matter how bad your headache is.

Hopefully, the rumours you heard yesterday about alien activities in this sector are just that, rumours...
