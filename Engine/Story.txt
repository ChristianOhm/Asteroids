The loud beeping noise of your navigation computers proximity alert wakes you up from fitful sleep. Red lights are flashing through your cockpit. Your head is aching and it takes a while to remember how you got here.

Last night, you had been celebrating a successful trading tour between the drug laboratories on planet Yavin 2 and Starbase 13, flooding the base's black market with synthetic drugs and earning you enough credits to make it through the next year. 

After drinking all night with strangers in the "Monkey Bar", all you wanted was getting back to earth. Maybe all that Synthenol in your blood didn’t help setting a proper course through that region of the gamma quadrant which is notoriously known for its asteroid fields.

Your small vessel shakes as the first piece of rock impacts with your shield arcs. You are surrounded by asteroids from all sites. To survive, you have to fight your way out, no matter how bad your headache is.

Hopefully, the rumours you heard yesterday about alien activities in this sector are just that, rumours...
